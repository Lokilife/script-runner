script-runner
=============

General purpose script runner for Windows.

Intended to be accompanied by the actual script file (.rb, .pl, .tcl, or no
extension) that will be executed using one of runners specified at compile
time (ruby.exe, perl.exe, tclsh.exe, tclkitsh.exe, etc.).

Building script-runner
======================

Run make ${lang}, where ${lang} is ruby, perl or tcl.

This will create script-runner-${lang}.exe that you can then copy under
any name you want (which depends on your script name).

How script-runner works
=======================

For executable named script.exe it will try to look for files named
script.ext (where .ext variants are defined at compile time) and for every
existing script.ext file it will try every runner (defined at compile time) in
order.

For example, for ruby stub named script.exe it will try:

    ruby.exe script.rb
    ruby.exe script

And for tcl stub named script.exe it will try:

    tclsh.exe script.tcl
    tclkitsh.exe script.tcl
    tclsh.exe script.kit
    tclkitsh.exe script.kit
    tclsh.exe script
    tclkitsh.exe script

Extensions and runners are defined in script-runner-${lang}.c files.
